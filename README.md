# Screaming Halloween Cauldrons

Inspired by Adafruit's [@johnedgarpark](https://twitter.com/johnedgarpark), I created a set of screaming Halloween cauldrons for use in a preschool trunk or treat event. 
Using four Sharp proximity sensors, four [Trinket M0s](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500), an [AudioFX board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2220), a small CircuitPython script, and a speaker I was able to get a few frightened jumps out of the kids. 

This same concept could be repurposed to play a [Christmas jingle](https://github.com/eat-sleep-code/circuitpython-christmas "Get the code for a Christmas version of this project")  when people approach your front door, an alarm when your annoying sibling is invading your room, or a tone when a customer enters a store.
